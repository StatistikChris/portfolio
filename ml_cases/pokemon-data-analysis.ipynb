    "**Pokemon** is a global icon to children and adults everywhere. It is a TV series that has expanded into video games, card games, movies, merchandise and everything inbetween. The motivation behind this analysis is to further understand the dynamics of the pokemon universe through data. Part of this notebook is being built off the process used in  [Rachel Tatman's kernal]( https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/which-pokemon-win-the-most/notebook). She has done some fanstatic work and does an excellent job explaing her thought process. I am interested in improving my python skills, so I will replicate her work from R to python and develop further analysis. I will be looking at missing values and getting some simple calcualtions in. I will then visualize some results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I will conclude the venture with some machine learning and PCA to try and predict the win percentage of the pokemon. \n",

    "Data analysis is a powerful tool. However, simply creating visualizations and preditions is not enough to drive decisions in the business world. I will do my best to explain each figure and calculation and how it could be useful to a business in the Pokemon Universe. This is what I am thinking. Let's say there is a company called \"**Team Rocket**\" who makes millions of dollars off of pokemon battles (I do not condone animal violence in any way, shape or form and no Pokemon were injured during this analysis). As a data consultant, **Team Rocket** gives you this data set and ask you to come up with some useful insight on how to improve their business. This can be difficult because there in not much direction given for the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the task. \n",
    ">  1. Understand the business: Team Rocket funds their illegal activities through winning pokemon battles and tournaments. Thus, we will want our analysis to be directed towards finding the best pokemon. \n",
    ">  2. Start shallow and dive deeper: As we explore the data, I think its best practice to start the investigation at a higher lever then work our way down and traverse the data. \n",
    ">  3. Drive Business Decisions: Once out analysis is complete, relate it back to the business and make suggestions for areas Team Rocket could improve in.\n"

    "There is a clear difference between Poekmon that win and lose. The most obvious reason to me are the vast differences in their stats. From a quick glance it appears that attack and speed are significantly higher in Pokemon that win. I also would like to point out two other oberservations. There are several winning pokemon with the Prefix \"**Mega**\". I am not sure the difference between **Mega Aerodactyl** and regular  **Aerodactyl** but I'm confident that plays a role. Perhaps asking my 7 year old cousin about the difference could help.\n",

    "Which actually brings up a good point. As you drive into the data, there might be anolomlies that dont make sense but you have a \"gut\" feeling that there might be a correlation to the outcome. This is why understanding the buisness and where the data is coming from is so very crutial to helping the business out. In this case of \"Mega\" vs \"non-Mega\", maybe finding \"Mega\" pokemon in the wild is much more difficult and cost a lot more resources (ie: Time, pokeball quality, more potions and stronger pokemon to catch it). For these reasons, even though the Mega Aerodactyl wins more often the business cost might outweight the potential business revenue. \n",

Even though it doesnt tell me the exact population (ie. there are 1 million grass type 1 pokemon in the world), what it doesnt tell me is which attributes are most apparent. How this can be usefull is possibly predicting the liklihood of battling a particular type of pokemon and having a counter type to it. For example, a water type pokemon. Since we know water pokemon are weak agaisnt grass or electric, it might be a good idea to keep one of those types in our battle squad. \n",

This means a majority of the pokemon stats are on average higher than the median value for the set. However, the density for the win percentage is different. Comparing the density plot with the frequency plot in the pairplot for 'Win Percentage' we see a more uniformly distribution of the rate at which pokemon win with a slight decrease of the frequency at higher levels. \n",

Esentially the slope of the line y=mx+b, where m is the slope is the correlation value between the two variables. Thus we would expect to see a simialr pattern if we were to build a heat map or a correlation table. What I am most interested in is the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable (Win Percentage). The greater the slope, m, the more correlated the values are in determining the liklihood of winning. Just by 'eye balling' it (not the most mathmematically correct method), but it appears that **speed** and **attack** have the largest relationship to winning. Lets take a closer look into these two plots given below. \n",

The figure with colors is more pleasant to look at and when discussing results with** Team Rocket** executives, I would used the \"Pokemon Feature Correlation\" plot. The diagonal of the plot all the correlations are 1.0, which is perfectly positively correlated. This is becase the diagonal compares each feature to itself. Also, if we were to fold the matrix in half down the diagonal, it would be perfectly semmetical. The top half above the diagonal provides the same information as the lower half. While it might be interesting to look at how the independent features are correlated, I think for our business problem we investigate the features correlated to \"win %\".

It could be because of a combiantion of the parameters I am using for each of the models. I definetly didnt put very much effort into trying to optomize the results.
